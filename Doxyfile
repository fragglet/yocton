# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
# for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = .

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of
# the entity):The $name class, The $name widget, The $name file, is, provides,
# specifies, contains, represents, a, an and the.

# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 8

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented members inside documented classes or files. If set to NO these

# section is generated. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. If set

# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = .

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and

#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cpp,

# Configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set the YES then doxygen will generate a

# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for
# the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript and DHTML and
# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_MAN is set to YES.

MAN_SUBDIR             =

# If the MAN_LINKS tag is set to YES and doxygen generates man output, then it
# will generate one additional man file for each entity documented in the real
# man page(s). These additional files only source the real man page, but without
# them the man command would be unable to find the correct page.
# The default value is: NO.

# C-preprocessor directives found in the sources and include files.
# The default value is: YES.

ENABLE_PREPROCESSING   = YES

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES, doxygen will expand all macro names
# in the source code. If set to NO, only conditional compilation will be
# performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting
# EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.
