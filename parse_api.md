# Yocton Parse API  {#yocton_parse_api}

This document is intended as an introductory guide to the Yocton parsing API.
Let's start with a basic example that shows how to open an input file and read
a single property:

```c
FILE *fs = fopen(filename, "r");
assert(fs != NULL);

struct yocton_object *obj = yocton_read_from(fs);
assert(obj != NULL);

struct yocton_prop *p = yocton_next_prop(obj);
assert(p != NULL);

printf("property %s has value %s\n", yocton_prop_name(p),
       yocton_prop_value(p));
```

This example shows the basic boilerplate of how to get started with the API.
A Yocton document is an object (@ref yocton_object) which contains properties
(@ref yocton_prop). We can expand the example into one that prints every
property in a file:

```c
FILE *fs = fopen(filename, "r");
assert(fs != NULL);

struct yocton_object *obj = yocton_read_from(fs);
assert(obj != NULL);

struct yocton_prop *p;
while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
  printf("property %s has value %s\n", yocton_prop_name(p),
         yocton_prop_value(p));
}
```

However, this example only works when all property values are strings.
Property values may instead be objects; these can be accessed using
`yocton_prop_inner()`. Using this we can construct a recursive function that
reads and prints all properties of all subobjects:

```c
void print_obj(struct yocton_object *obj) {
  struct yocton_prop *p;
  while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
    if (yocton_prop_type(p) == YOCTON_PROP_OBJECT) {
      printf("property %s has subobject...\n", yocton_prop_name(p));
      print_obj(yocton_prop_inner(p));
      printf("end of property %s.\n", yocton_prop_name(p));
    } else {
      printf("property %s has value %s\n", yocton_prop_name(p),
             yocton_prop_value(p));
    }
  }
}
```

## The pull parsing model

The APIs for many serialization formats are often document based, where data
is deserialized into a document object that can then inspected (examples are
the XML DOM, and protocol buffers). Yocton instead uses a *pull parser*.
With a pull parser, it is up to the caller to read data one item at a time.
This avoids the need for either autogenerated code (as with protobufs) or
complicated APIs - Yocton's API is minimalist and simple to learn.

The API has been designed with a particular approach in mind to using input
data to populate data structures.  It is assumed that Yocton objects will
correspond to C structs, and object properties will correspond to C struct
fields. Here's a simple example of how a struct might be read and populated;
the example struct here is a minimal one containing a single string field:

```c
struct foo {
    char *bar;
};

struct foo *read_foo(struct foo *f, struct yocton_object *obj) {
  struct yocton_prop *p;

  while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
    if (!strcmp(yocton_prop_name(p), "bar")) {
      f->bar = yocton_prop_value_dup(p);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

While this is relatively easy to understand, it looks quite verbose. It is
therefore important to note that there are convenience functions and macros to
make things much simpler; see below.

Yocton is a recursive format where objects can also contain other objects. The
assumption is that a subobject likely corresponds to a field with a struct
type. For example:

```c
struct baz {
  struct foo *my_foo;
};

struct qux {
  struct baz my_baz;
};
```

might be serialized in Yocton format as:

```js
my_baz {
  my_foo {
    bar: "hello world!"
  }
}
```

When subobjects are mapped to struct types in this way, a function can be
written that reads and populates each type of struct. In the examples above,
`read_foo()` might be complemented with `read_baz()` and `read_qux()`
functions. This makes for clear and readable deserialization code; the approach
also means that the individual functions can be tested in isolation.

## Reading properties and populating variables

Yocton properties can contain arbitrary strings, the contents of which are open
to interpretation by the code that is reading them. In practice though, the
values are often likely to be one of several common base types which every C
programmer is familiar with. There are convenience functions to help parse
values into these types:

| Function                | Purpose
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| yocton_prop_int()       | Parse value as a signed integer. Works with all integer types, performs bounds checking, etc. |
| yocton_prop_uint()      | Parse value as an unsigned integer. Works with all unsigned integer types, performs bounds checking, etc. |
| yocton_prop_value_dup() | Returns the value as a plain, freshly allocated string, performing the appropriate checking for memory allocation failure.  Useful for populating string fields. |
| yocton_prop_enum()      | Parse value as an enum value by looking it up in an array of strings. Useful for representing values symbolically rather than just as raw integers. |

While these functions are useful, in most cases it is more convenient to use
the preprocessor macros which are specifically intended for populating
variables (and struct fields).

| Type                   | Macro                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| String                 | @ref YOCTON_VAR_STRING       |
| Signed integer         | @ref YOCTON_VAR_INT          |
| Unsigned integer       | @ref YOCTON_VAR_UINT         |
| Enum                   | @ref YOCTON_VAR_ENUM         |

For the following example we will populate the `foo` struct:

```c
enum e { FIRST, SECOND, THIRD };
struct foo {
  enum e enum_value;
  int signed_value;
  unsigned int unsigned_value;
  char *string_value;
};
```

The input can be parsed and the struct populated using the following code:

```c
const char *enum_names[] = {"FIRST", "SECOND", "THIRD", NULL};
struct foo x = {0, 0, 0, NULL};
struct yocton_prop *p;
while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
  YOCTON_VAR_ENUM(p, "enum_val", x.enum_value, enum_names);
  YOCTON_VAR_INT(p, "signed_val", int, x.signed_value) ;
  YOCTON_VAR_UINT(p, "unsigned_val", unsigned int, x.unsigned_value);
  YOCTON_VAR_STRING(p, "string_val", x.string_value);
}
```

In the above example the fields of a struct are being populated, but this does
not have to be the case; for example the following would set an ordinary
variable:

```c
char *string_value = NULL;
struct yocton_prop *p;
while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
  YOCTON_VAR_STRING(p, "string_val", string_value);
}
```

An important point to note is that these macros are internally designed to
provide a simple and convenient API, not for efficiency. If performance is
essential or becomes a bottleneck, it may be preferable to avoid using these
macros.

## Pointer types

Sometimes we might have a pointer variable, and want to initialize that
variable when a particular property is read.
For example, consider the following input:

```js
foo {
  val: "hello world"
}
```

We might want to use this to initialize the following pointer variable:

```c
struct foo {
  char *val;
};

struct foo *my_foo = NULL;
```

In this scenario, we can use `YOCTON_VAR_PTR` to allocate a new `struct foo`.
In the following example, when `YOCTON_VAR_PTR` matches a property named
`foo`, a new `struct foo` is allocated, `my_foo` is initialized to point to
it, and `parse_foo()` is called to populate it from the property's object
value.

```c
void parse_foo(struct yocton_object *obj, struct foo *my_foo);

struct yocton_prop *p;

while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
  YOCTON_VAR_PTR(p, "foo", my_foo, {
    parse_bar(yocton_prop_inner(p), my_foo);
  })
}
```

## Representing lists

The Yocton format has no special way of representing lists. Since property
names do not have to be unique, it is simple enough to represent a list using
multiple properties with the same name.

As with the previous example that described how to populate variables (and
struct fields) with base types, convenience macros also exist for constructing
arrays. The main difference is that an extra variable (or struct field) is
needed to store the array length.

| Type                   | Macro                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| String array           | @ref YOCTON_VAR_STRING_ARRAY |
| Signed integer array   | @ref YOCTON_VAR_INT_ARRAY    |
| Unsigned integer array | @ref YOCTON_VAR_UINT_ARRAY   |
| Enum array             | @ref YOCTON_VAR_ENUM_ARRAY   |
| Generic array          | @ref YOCTON_VAR_ARRAY        |

For example:

```c
enum e { FIRST, SECOND, THIRD };
struct bar {
  enum e *enum_values;
  size_t num_enum_values;
  int *signed_values;
  size_t num_signed_values;
  unsigned int *unsigned_values;
  size_t num_unsigned_values;
  char **string_values;
  size_t num_string_values;
};
```

The parsing code looks very similar to the previous example:

```c
const char *enum_names[] = {"FIRST", "SECOND", "THIRD", NULL};
struct bar x = {NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL, 0};
struct yocton_prop *p;
while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
  YOCTON_VAR_ENUM_ARRAY(p, "enum_val", x.enum_values,
                        x.num_enum_values, enum_names);
  YOCTON_VAR_INT_ARRAY(p, "signed_val", int, x.signed_values,
                       x.num_signed_values);
  YOCTON_VAR_UINT_ARRAY(p, "unsigned_val", unsigned int,
                        x.unsigned_values, x.num_unsigned_values);
  YOCTON_VAR_STRING_ARRAY(p, "string_val", x.string_values,
                          x.num_string_values);
}
```

While these macros are convenient for building arrays of base types, often it
is preferable to construct arrays of more complex data structures. The above
macros are built on another macro named `YOCTON_VAR_ARRAY` which can be used
to achieve this goal. `YOCTON_VAR_ARRAY` does the following:

1. Check if the name of the property matches a particular name.
2. If the name matches, the array pointer is reallocated to allot space for a
new element at the end of the array.
3. An arbitrary block of code is executed that can (optionally) populate the
new array element.

Here is an example:

```c
struct foo {
  struct bar *elements;
  size_t num_elements;
};
struct foo x;
struct yocton_prop *p;

while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
  YOCTON_VAR_ARRAY(p, "element", x.elements, x.num_elements, {
    populate_element(yocton_prop_inner(p),
                     &x.elements[x.num_elements]);
    x.num_elements++;
  });
}
```

## Arrays of pointers

The previous section covered how to construct an array of structs.  The
analogous `YOCTON_VAR_PTR_ARRAY` can be used to construct an array of struct
pointers. Consider the following input (same input as the previous section):

```js
item { val: 1 }
item { val: 2 }
item { val: 3 }
```

We might want to parse this input into the following array (note the
difference to the previous section; this is an array of *pointers to*
structs):

```c
struct foo {
  int val;
};

struct foo **items = NULL;
int num_items = 0;
```

In the following example, when `YOCTON_VAR_PTR_ARRAY` matches a property named
`item`, a new `struct foo` is allocated and appended to the `items` array, and
the `parse_foo()` function is called to populate the struct's contents from the
property's inner object value. Finally, the length of the array `num_items` is
incremented.

```c
void parse_foo(struct yocton_object *obj, struct foo *item);

while ((p = yocton_next_prop(obj)) != NULL) {
  YOCTON_VAR_PTR_ARRAY(p, "item", items, num_items, {
    parse_foo(yocton_prop_inner(p), items[num_items]);
    num_items++;
  });
}
```

## Error handling

There are many different types of error that can occur while parsing a Yocton
file. For example:

* Syntax error
* Memory allocation failure
* Property has unexpected type (string for an object property, or vice versa)
* Invalid property value (eg. overflow when parsing an integer value)
* Violation of a user-provided constraint

Continual checking for error conditions can make for complicated code. The
Yocton API instead adopts an "error state" mechanism for error reporting. Write
your code assuming success, and at the end, check once if an error occurred.

Here's how this works in practice: most parsing code involves continually
calling `yocton_next_prop()` to read new properties from the file. If an error
condition is reached, this function will stop returning any more properties. In
effect it is like reaching the end of file. So when "end of file" is reached,
simply check if an error occurred or whether the document was successfully
parsed.

Here is a simple example of what this might look like:

```c
// Returns true if file was successfully parsed:
bool parse_config_file(const char *filename, struct config_data *cfg)
{
  FILE *fs;
  struct yocton_object *obj;
  const char *error_msg;
  int lineno;
  bool success;

  fs = fopen(filename, "r");
  if (fs == NULL) {
    return false;
  }

  obj = yocton_read_from(fs);
  parse_config_toplevel(obj, cfg);

  success = !yocton_have_error(obj, &lineno, &error_msg);
  if (!success) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error in parsing config:\n%s:%d:%s\n",
            filename, lineno, error_msg);
  }

  yocton_free(obj);
  fclose(fs);
  return success;
}
```

Some of the API functions will also trigger the error state. It may be tempting
to add extra checks in your code to avoid this happening, but it is better that
you do not. If an error is triggered in this way, it is likely that it is due
to an error in the file being parsed. Your API calls implicitly document the
expected format of the input file. If the file does not conform to that format,
it is the file that is wrong, not your code.

An example may be illustrative. Suppose your Yocton files contain a property
called `name` which is expected to have a string value. If the property has an
object value instead, a call to `yocton_prop_value()` to get the expected
string value will trigger the error state. That is not a misuse of the API;
your code is implicitly indicating that a string was expected, and the input is
therefore erroneous. The line number where the error occurred is logged, just
the same as if the file itself was syntactically incorrect.
